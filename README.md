# check_number
I created this code using a function called check_number(num), which converts the user's input into an integer and determines whether the number is odd or even using the modulus operator. To handle invalid input gracefully, I included a try-except block that displays an appropriate error message. Finally, I prompted the user for input, passed it to the function, and returned the result.
